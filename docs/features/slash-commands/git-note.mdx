The `/gitnote` command transforms your Cline task conversations into structured, persistent documentation attached directly to your Git commits. It's designed to capture the crucial "why" behind your code, making your Git history a rich source of knowledge for the entire team.

This feature is built for modern development workflows where the conversation with an AI is as important as the code itself. It enables automated documentation and helps new developers understand the rationale behind complex features.

## The Workflow

The `/gitnote` command is state-aware. It behaves differently depending on whether you've used it before in the current task.

1.  **First Use:** On its first run within a task, `/gitnote` creates a "master note." This comprehensive note summarizes the entire task objective, key architectural decisions, and attaches it to a commit (either `HEAD` or a specific SHA you provide).
2.  **Subsequent Uses:** If you run `/gitnote` again in the same task (for a later commit), it intelligently finds the original master note and *updates it* with a new "delta" section. This builds an evolutionary history of the feature's development across multiple commits, all consolidated in one place.

## Usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the Command">
    After making one or more commits for a task, type `/gitnote` in the chat.
    ```bash
    /gitnote
    ```
    To target a specific commit, provide its SHA:
    ```bash
    /gitnote a1b2c3d4
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cline Generates the Note">
    Cline will analyze the conversation, generate a structured note based on the template below, and attach it to the target commit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Your Note">
    You can view the note directly from your terminal:
    ```bash
    git notes show <commit_sha>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Git Note Template

All notes generated by `/gitnote` follow a structured, machine-readable format perfect for both human readers and automated scripts.

# Cline Task Summary: User Profile Caching Layer

**Task ID:** abc123xyz456
**Master Note for Commit:** a1b2c3d

### 1. Objective
Implement a caching layer using Redis to reduce database load.

### 2. Public Interface Changes
No public-facing API changes.

### 3. Key Decisions & Rationale (Overall)
- **Why Redis?**
  - **Decision:** Chose Redis over an in-memory cache.
  - **Rationale:** To support future scalability.

---
### 4. Commit History & Deltas

#### **Commit `a1b2c3d` (Initial Implementation)**
- **Overview:** Laid the foundational Redis client.
- **Key Changes:**
  - `A services/redis_client.py`: Created the singleton Redis client.

#### **Commit `f4e5d6c` (Refinement & Invalidation)**
- **Rationale for this commit:** The initial implementation lacked a cache invalidation strategy.
- **Key Changes:**
  - `M services/user_service.py`: Added cache invalidation on update.

This structured approach turns your Git history into a self-documenting knowledge base.
